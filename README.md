# Quantum One-Time Pad Encryption using Quirk

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP)** encryption protocol using the [Quirk Quantum Circuit Simulator](https://algassert.com/quirk). The primary goal is to securely transmit a classical message by utilizing quantum principles such as superposition, entanglement, and measurement.

## Features

### ðŸ”¹ Quantum Key Generation
- Used **Hadamard gates (H)** to place key qubits in superposition.
- Generated random key bits essential for secure encryption.

### ðŸ”¹ Message Encoding with CNOT Gates
- Applied **Controlled-NOT (CNOT)** gates to entangle message qubits with the key.
- Achieved message encryption by quantum entanglement.

### ðŸ”¹ Message Decoding and Measurement
- Applied a second set of **Hadamard gates (H)** to decode the key.
- Measured all qubits to extract the final key and decrypted message.

### ðŸ”¹ Eavesdropper Detection
- Any attempt to intercept or measure the qubits before decoding causes observable disturbances in the system, highlighting QOTP's inherent security advantages.
